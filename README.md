- Hi! I'm @nmonette, a Computer Science and Engineering Student at UC Irvine. 
- I am interested in the gaming industry, as well as the integration of software and hardware, but I am open to learning more about the different industries of CS. 
- Here I keep my projects, which I plan on keeping here to share what I have learned and my coding skills (so far, I know some Python!)
